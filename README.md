# Infinite Runner Made In Pygame
An infinite runner made in pygame, which is a python game development library. Not much too it; simply jump when the enemies come near you. This project was an improvement on Lemaster Tech's tutorial. I simply added the color, scoring system, and added minor things like progressive difficulty. This was my first pygmae project, but I learned that I am not a good game developer.
